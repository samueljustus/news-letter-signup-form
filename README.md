## My process
started with te html and css then i added the javascript for the index.html and thankyou.html files then i moved
on to making it responsive with media queries

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i learnt how to submit forms with javscript and querystrings. this was the first time i use the GET method on my form
so i learnt how to use this method to get the values in a form.

```html
<form method ="GET"></form>
```
```
const param = new URLSearhParam(window.location.search)
```
### Continued development
i'd continue learning about web apis till i get really comfortable with them
